ArrayList
- growable array, by default size is 10 if not given. on insert 11th element it will create new object array with size 15(current 10+ 10/2), copy all 10 element in to new array and add 11th one in new array.


private static final long serialVersionUID = -2479143000061671589L; 
not mandatory but we must put it. why?
While doing serialization we are on JDK1.5 so class version is x but while deserialization v r on JDK 1.7 then class version will be different then x. at that time it will check the "serialVersionUID".
