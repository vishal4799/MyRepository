//Interface was essentially set of abstract methods
//By Default all methods were abstract
//fields in interface are static and final
//interfaces were used to achieve multiple inheritance
//interfaces were used to relate unrelated classes
//interfaces are used to hide implementation details
//Approach--Design to interface, not to implementation
//if interface had no method, interface is called marker interface
